          <p class="eManual-p">Written approval is required by pipeline owners and may be required by other facility owners whose facilities are in a right of way on private land. Always contact the facility owner for information on whether or not a crossing agreement is required. It may take up to 21 days for a facility owner to respond to an agreement request.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p"><strong>The crossing agreement, signed by authorized representatives of both the facility owner and the crossor, must be in effect and on site prior to any work commencing on the right of way.</strong></p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The procedures outlined in these sections should be followed for any work considered by the facility owner to be of a major nature. Minor work or simple crossings that involve no excavation may at the discretion of the facility owner, be handled by other forms of agreement.</p>
