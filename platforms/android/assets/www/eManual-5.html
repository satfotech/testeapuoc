          <p class="eManual-p">Fencing may be specified in the crossing agreement by the facility owner in order to protect buried facilities from heavy equipment and to guide machine operators to designated travelways.</p>

          <p class="parawlist">It is the ground disturber or crossor’s responsibility to do the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Install and maintain fencing as specified (usually snow fencing).</li>
            <li>Install temporary fencing (as required) to reasonably protect open excavations left overnight or longer.</li>
            <li>As an alternative to fencing, backfill excavation temporarily with sand.</li>
            <li>Install road barricades and construction signs as required.</li>
            <li>Install warning signs with flashers by the fence if near a roadway.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="eManual-p">As per Occupational Health and Safety Code Part 32 Section 444 Marking an Excavation.</p>

          <div class="heading"><a name="C5.2">5.2. Construct Ramps and/or Matting</a></div>

          <p class="parawlist">The facility owner should specify where and how the ground disturber is to construct ramps and/or matting. Following are some guidelines:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ramps and/or matting are normally required where vulnerable facilities are crossed.</li>
            <li>Temporary crossing ramps and/or matting may be installed over the facility right of way to maintain adequate clearance between the traveled surface of the ramp and/or matting and the facility (1.5m or as otherwise specified by the facility owner).</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="parawlist">The ground disturber should:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Construct ramps so that the fill is pushed onto the right of way with a bulldozer prior to the equipment traveling onto the right of way.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="pageNumber">46</div>
        </div>

        <div class="pageContent">

          <ul>
            <li>Inspect ramps and/or matting periodically to ensure that they have not settled.</li>
            <li>Use rip-rap/rig mats or other mechanical protection as required by the facility owner between the ground surface and the ramp, as required by the facility owner.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="heading"><a name="C5.3">5.3. Expose Facility</a></div>

          <p class="eManual-p"><strong>Hand digging or other non-destructive excavation technique is mandatory!</strong></p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The facility owner should specify this in the crossing agreement. Hand exposure is required to positively identify facility location, direction and depth before mechanical excavation is permitted within 5m of the facility.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The ground disturber must expose facilities at point of crossing by hand digging 600mm on either side of the facility and to the full depth of the trench, ditch or other disturbance. 600mm is a minimum and may be extended by the owner if justified by safety or engineering considerations. The assigned inspector must be present during facility exposure.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The use of hydrovac or airvac (see Section 4.8) requires the facility owner’s approval.</p>

          <p class="parawlist">Adhere to Occupational Health and Safety Code:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Shore trenches and excavations against caving in.</li>
            <li>Access and exit by ladder.</li>
            <li>Monitor for presence of toxic flammable gases.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper slope of walls (limits).</li>
            <li>Keep edges of excavation free of loose soil, debris, spoil piles and material stockpiles.</li>
            <li>Obtain an Occupational Health and Safety Work Space Entry Permit if required.</li>
            <li>Take care when the machine approaches the outer limits of the hand excavation area.</li>

          <div class="heading"><a name="C5.4">5.4. Backfill</a></div>

          <p class="parawlist">The facility inspector must be on site during the backfill operation and detailed as-built drawings should be made before backfilling. The ground disturber should follow these guidelines during the backfill process:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Notify facility owner at least 24 hours prior to backfill operations.</li>
            <li>Backfill using sand or other select material for initial backfill as specified by the facility owner.</li>
            <li>Shovel sand around and under pipe to provide firm support.</li>
            <li>Do not use heavy vibrating equipment for compaction directly over pipelines until sufficient cover is in place or as per facility owner requirements.</li>
            <li>Where fill may otherwise settle, compact with hand operated compactor in approximately 150mm layers or as agreed upon with the facility owner, compacting each layer to prevent future settlement.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="heading"><a name="C5.5">5.5. Restore Site</a></div>

          <p class="eManual-p">Responsibility for site restoration (i.e., top soil replacement, re-seeding, etc.) is usually specified in the crossing agreement. Usually, this is part of the ground disturber’s work.</p>

          <p class="parawlist">The ground disturber should follow these guidelines:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Compact sufficiently to prevent future settlement so that the restored surface is level and compatible with original surface.</li>
            <li>Remove temporary fencing and barricades.</li>
            <li>Remove temporary buildings.</li>
            <li>Remove all temporary markers (pin flags and lath).</li>
            <li>Remove spoil piles, garbage and other debris.</li>
