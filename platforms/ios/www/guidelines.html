        <h3>Where Buried Facilities May Be Found.</h3>

        <p>An extensive network of buried facilities may be found at depths, ranging from just below the surface to very deep. This makes all these facilities susceptible/vulnerable to damage by ground disturbance activities. These facilities may be found on public or private property, rights of way or easements. In other words, buried facilities can be found anywhere at any depth.</p>

        <p>In urban areas and on private property, many facilities are within 300mm of the ground surface. Street light wires are often just below the sidewalk. Communication and electrical duct banks in downtown cores may be just under the asphalt.</p>

        <p>The depth of initial cover over buried facilities may be substantially reduced where they have floated in wet areas or due to landscaping, soil erosion or agricultural activity.</p>

        <div class="heading"><a name="C1.1">1.1 The Hazards of Poorly Planned Ground Disturbances</a></div>

        <h3>How Can Buried Facilities Be Damaged?</h3>
        <p>Even minor nicks and gouges on pipelines and other buried facilities are serious. Corrosion could occur rapidly causing leaks, possible emergency situations, and the interruption of utility and communication services. Negligence, sloppy workmanship, lack of awareness, poor planning, or thoughtlessness, may result in severe penalties to those responsible.</p>

      <u>Improper/Unsafe Exposure Techniques</u><br />
      <p>Hydro Vacing or Daylighting as it is also referred to, has become a popular alternative method of hand exposing underground facilities particularly in frozen ground or around sensitive facilities such Fiber Optic Lines, High Pressure Pipelines and High Voltage Power Lines. This process may be used where mechanical excavation is prohibited or not practical. Some companies have their own equipment used for this purpose while others will contract this service. This process uses a combination of high pressure and/or high temperature water that has the potential to damage facilities by damaging the protective coating. This can cause an immediate failure or a failure over time.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      If anyone has any questions concerning the procedure for exposure of facilities by this process please call the operator of the facility for clarification. Facility owners require an inspector on site to supervise the work and conduct an inspection prior to back filling

  <div class="heading"><a name="C1.3">1.3. Legal Requirements (Guideline Only)</a></div>

  <p>There are legal or regulatory requirements that need to be adhered to prior to commencing a ground disturbance or traveling across buried facilities with vehicles or equipment exceeding ¾ ton (excluding normal farming related equipment and recreational off road vehicles). It is your responsibility</p>

  <p>to contact the facility owner and/or landowner prior to conducting ground disturbance activities to ensure that you comply with any legal or regulatory requirements.</p>

  <p>One typical requirement is a crossing agreement. Usually, three parties are involved in a crossing agreement.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b>owner </b>of the existing facility (the grantor).</li>
    <li>The <b>crossor</b>, the party undertaking the crossing (sometimes called the grantee).</li>
    <li>The <b>contractor </b>hired by the crossor to do the physical work in the crossing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A crossing approval or crossing agreement is a regulatory requirement that must be in place before the ground within a buried facility right of way is disturbed. The <b>owner </b>must execute a crossing agreement with the crossor, keep track of the agreement routing, and ensure that it accurately reflects the legal requirements of the crossing. It is the <b>crossor’s</b> responsibility to check all known records for buried facilities and obtain the necessary agreement(s) from the owner(s) and to ensure all involved parties are aware of the requirements. The <b>contractor </b>is responsible for ensuring that the required agreement(s) have been obtained and are at the work site.</p>

  <p>The contractor must give the facility owner notice before disturbing the ground within a controlled area (30 m from the centerline of the pipeline - AER regulated) or the prescribed area (30 meters from the centerline of the pipeline - NEB regulated) and follow the provisions in the agreement that affects his part of the job. If, for any reason, the contractor has not been briefed, consult the facility owner before you dig.</p>

  <p><em>Consult the applicable acts and regulations.</em></p>

<div class="pageContent">

  <p>Attention: If you are found to be in contravention of governing acts and regulations you may be subject to personal fines and or imprisonment. To avoid such penalties it is your responsibility to be in compliance.</p>
