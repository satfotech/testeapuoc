          <h3 class="eManual-h3">Where Buried Facilities May Be Found.</h3>

          <p class="eManual-p">An extensive network of buried facilities may be found at depths, ranging from just below the surface to very deep. This makes all these facilities susceptible/vulnerable to damage by ground disturbance activities. These facilities may be found on public or private property, rights of way or easements. In other words, buried facilities can be found anywhere at any depth.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p">In urban areas and on private property, many facilities are within 300mm of the ground surface. Street light wires are often just below the sidewalk. Communication and electrical duct banks in downtown cores may be just under the asphalt.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The depth of initial cover over buried facilities may be substantially reduced where they have floated in wet areas or due to landscaping, soil erosion or agricultural activity.</p>

          <div class="heading"><a name="C1.1">1.1 The Hazards of Poorly Planned Ground Disturbances</a></div>

          <h3 class="eManual-h3">How Can Buried Facilities Be Damaged?</h3>
          <p class="eManual-p">Even minor nicks and gouges on pipelines and other buried facilities are serious. Corrosion could occur rapidly causing leaks, possible emergency situations, and the interruption of utility and communication services. Negligence, sloppy workmanship, lack of awareness, poor planning, or thoughtlessness, may result in severe penalties to those responsible.</p>

This process may be used where mechanical excavation is prohibited or not practical. Some companies have their own equipment used for this purpose while others will contract this service. This process uses a combination of high pressure and/or high temperature water that has the potential to damage facilities by damaging the protective coating.

          <p class="eManual-p">There are legal or regulatory requirements that need to be adhered to prior to commencing a ground disturbance or traveling across buried facilities with vehicles or equipment exceeding ¾ ton (excluding normal farming related equipment and recreational off road vehicles).

          </ul>

          <p class="eManual-p">A crossing approval or crossing agreement is a regulatory requirement that must be in place before the ground within a buried facility right of way is disturbed. The <b>owner </b>must execute a crossing agreement with the crossor, keep track of the agreement routing, and ensure that it accurately reflects the legal requirements of the crossing. It is the <b>crossor’s</b> responsibility to check all known records for buried facilities and obtain the necessary agreement(s) from the owner(s) and to ensure all involved parties are aware of the requirements. The <b>contractor </b>is responsible for ensuring that the required agreement(s) have been obtained and are at the work site.</p>

          <p class="eManual-p">The contractor must give the facility owner notice before disturbing the ground within a controlled area (30 m from the centerline of the pipeline - AER regulated) or the prescribed area (30 meters from the centerline of the pipeline - NEB regulated) and follow the provisions in the agreement that affects his part of the job. If, for any reason, the contractor has not been briefed, consult the facility owner before you dig.</p>
